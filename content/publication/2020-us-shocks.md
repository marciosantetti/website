abstract = "We  propose  a  novel  methodological  approach  to  disentangle  the  main  structuralshocks affecting  the  US  labour  share  of  income  during  the  immediate  post-warera  (1948Q1-1984Q4)  and  the  Great  Moderation  (1985Q1-2018Q3).  We  motivatea  SVAR  model  in aggregate demand, unemployment rate, real wage and labourproductivity, which captures key components of the labour share. The paperthen (i) demonstrates statistical support for separating the sample into twoperiods; (ii) employs the model to identify four structural innovations:  aggregatedemand,  laboursupply,  wage  bargaining,  and  productivity;  (iii) quantifies thedynamic responses of the labour share to each structural shock; (iv) comparesthese results across the two periods; and (v) indicates their robustness toestimation of the impulse  responses  with  stationary  variables  or  in  levels,  and  vialocal  projections.  The results  show  that  the  two  periods  differ  substantially.First,  in  order  of  magnitude,  thelabour  share  responded  mainly  to  productivity,aggregate  demand,  and  wage  bargaining shocks  during  the  immediate  post-warera;  whereas  wage  bargaining,  productivity,  and aggregate  demand  shocksmattered  most  during  the  Great  Moderation.  Second,  these impulse responsesare statistically significantly different across the two periods for wage bargainingand productivity shocks. Increased (decreased) sensitivity to wage bargaining(productivity) shocks during the Great Moderation suggests that the decline inthe labour share is driven by the factors that govern wage setting."
