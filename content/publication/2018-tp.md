abstract = "In this study, technical progress is analysed in terms of its influence on the mix of inputs of labour, capital and energy that go into the production of gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results of this analysis show that  the  Brazilian  economy  exhibited  a  Marx-biased  pattern  of  technical  progress  during the period under study. Within the framework of this overall pattern, however, three  different  phases  of  technical  progress  in  Brazil  can  be  identified.  Between  1970 and 1980, a Marx-biased pattern was observed, followed by the stagnation of technical progress between 1980 and 2003. In the years from 2003 to 2012, the pattern of technical change was Harrod-neutral."
