Teaching has been part of my life since High School, when I worked as an electric guitar instructor. Since going to graduate school is much more profitable than being a successful musician, I started teaching Economics as soon as I entered in the Ph.D. program at the University of Utah. I have mostly taught quantitative methods (Probabiliy & Statistics and Econometrics) at the undergraduate level, and it has become one of my passions.

My teaching philosophy gravitates around three main principles: empathy with students, the need for intuition, and marrying economic/statistical theory with real-world examples.
