My research interests gravitate around the empirical linkages between **technological progress** and a host of macroeconomic issues, such as *climate change*, *income distribution*, and *economic growth*. As the main driver of development, technology poses contradictory consequences to the economy and society: while it brings prosperity, it can also accentuate environmental and social disparities. 

My research emphasizes that technological variables stand out as relevant *structural* determinants of global warming,  income inequality, and long-run growth. Therefore, it requires a critical view on its mechanisms and institutional guidelines.

I have also done research on *International Economics* and the *History of Economic Thought*. In particular, I have investigated the economic effects of multilateral trade agreements, and long-run prospects for both economy and society.
