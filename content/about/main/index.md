  I am originally from Brazil, and started studying Economics at the age of 17. Back then, my main interest was to understand the how's and why's of the economic boom the Brazilian economy was experiencing throughout the 2000s. The Econ major was the way to understand, in addition to the economic, the social and political mechanisms behind economic growth processes.
  
  When I was introduced to data work in Statistics and Econometrics, all the quantitative character of Economics finally made practical sense. Then, in addition to studying growth and business cycles, I also started researching on the linkages between technological progress and climate change. 
  
  Beyond researching, teaching gives me the opportunity to make all the equations, models, and theories that surround us intuitive and empirically applicable to students. In my teaching, I am a big supporter of open-source software and reproducible coding. 
  
  In addition to my research and teaching, you can also check out my latest adventures in data work in my [blog](/blog).
