  Hello, I'm Marcio!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I'm happy that you are here!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). My research interests include empirical investigations on (*i*) how technological progress influences the natural environment, specifically through energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and (*ii*) how economic activity variables (e.g., capacity utilization, aggregate investment, and the employment rate) interact with price-distributive measures (e.g., the labor share of income and interest rates). You can check out my recent research pieces in [research](/publication).

I have also taught *Econometrics*, *Statistics*, and *Microeconomics* classes as lead instructor. Personally, I see teaching as a means to empower students with the necessary intuition about theory and practical skills with real-world examples and data. You can take a look at my teaching experience/materials in [teaching](/teaching).
