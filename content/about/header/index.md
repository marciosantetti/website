  Hello there!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I'm happy that you are here!

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Economics Department](https://www.skidmore.edu/economics/) at [Skidmore College](https://www.skidmore.edu/), in the beautiful Saratoga Springs, NY. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) in 2022. 

My research interests include empirical investigations on (*i*) how technological progress influences the natural environment, specifically through energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and (*ii*) how economic activity variables (e.g., capacity utilization, aggregate investment, and the employment rate) interact with price-distributive measures (e.g., the labor share of income and interest rates). You can check out my recent research pieces in [research](/publication).

I have also taught *Econometrics*, *Statistics*, *Microeconomics*, and introductory courses as lead instructor. Personally, I see teaching as a means to empower students with the necessary intuition about theory and practical skills with real-world examples and data. You can take a look at my teaching experience/materials in [teaching](/teaching).
