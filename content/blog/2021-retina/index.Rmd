## Motivation

Several times I got frustrated with blurry plots in Python.

I thought: I have a high-resolution display, so why to my plots do not look beautiful?



## Here's the solution

After some digging, I found the easiest solution. In your Jupyter notebook, type the following code (I recommend doing this in the same chunk where you load your modules, e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`):


```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
```



... and it couldn't be easier!

Happy (high-resolution) plotting!
