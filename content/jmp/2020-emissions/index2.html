<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The role played by technological progress to reduce aggregate carbon
dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions is not yet clear within the applied literature. This
paper addresses this issue by developing two different recursive Vector
Autoregressive (VAR) methodologies to investigate the short-run dynamic
interactions between aggregate carbon dioxide emissions and a set of
macroeconomic variables for the US economy over the 1949–2018 period.
Existing empirical procedures do not involve identification strategies solely
based on economic theory, and this study does so through two main
theoretical elements: an extended Kaya identity, including renewable
energy consumption and the number of employed workers, and the green
growth hypothesis, which ranks technological change as one of the leading
drivers of an absolute decoupling process. In both VAR estimations, I
compute aggregate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions responses to technology, non-renewable
and renewable energy use, population, and output structural shocks. Most
results indicate that technology and non-renewable energy use shocks
positive and significantly affect emissions over the short-run. Contrary
to a current belief within the theoretical literature, our results indicate
that technology shocks positively affect energy demand, while the latter’s
effect on the former is either negative or not significant. Finally, the
US historical technological progress path does not support an absolute
decoupling scenario among energy use, income, and emissions.</p>
